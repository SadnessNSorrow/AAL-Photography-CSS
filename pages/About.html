        <p>Why computer systems?</p>
        <p>I have been interested in computers since childhood. The computer system program sounded like one i could enjoy. I do not regret my choice, as i will able to work in a well-paid and interesting job later. The most interesting thing during the studies is the variety of this work and the opportunity to express yoursel in terms of design. Since my hobby is drawing, creating designs brings me joy. Being able to turn your idea into something real is a pleasant feeling. After studies, there are many specialties in whitch it is possible to get a job, such as working with databases, creating applications, websites, games and much more. Countless directions to go on adventure!</p>
        <p>Why a photographer's website?</p>
        <p>Because i enjoy to look at nature. Through the photos i can see the places i haven't travelled yet. Also, photographer's website is a good choice to test the selected frameworks, as they usually contain a lot of images and text that will provide the necessary load for testing.</p>
        <p>What's Next</p>
        <p>This project will be published in a forum so that anyone who has any doubts about which framework to use, can look at the results and get at least a little understanding of which software to use.</p>
